***Geting data from an API***

We'll use ```requests.get()``` to query the Yelp Business Search API.
```requests.get()``` needs a URL to get data from. 
The Yelp API also needs search parameters and authorization headers passed to the params and headers keyword arguments, respectively.
We'll need to extract the data from the response with its ```json()``` method, and pass it to pandas's ```DataFrame()``` function to make a dataframe.
The necessary data is under the dictionary key.
pandas (as pd) and requests have been loaded. Authorization data is in the dictionary headers, and the needed API parameters are stored as params.
