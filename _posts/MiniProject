I've been learning Python, so based on the python language we had done a mini-project which is ```Typing_Tester```
Where the user gets the text randomly which we used ```generate_text()``` function where we gave the text manually, It then waits for the user to Press 
the ```Enter key before starting the test```.


There is also a function called ```typing_test()`` that tests the user's typing accuracy and speed. 
The function imports the time module and a custom module ```generate_text``` that generates random text for the user to type.


The ```time.time()``` function is used to record the start and end times of the user's typing. 
The elapsed time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time.

The user's input is then compared to the generated text character by character. If the user input is shorter than the generated text, the
function counts the remaining characters as errors. If the user input matches the generated text, no errors are counted. If the user input
does not match the generated text, each incorrect character is counted as an error.

The function calculates the typing accuracy by subtracting the number of errors from the length of the generated text and dividing the 
result by the length of the generated text. This value is then multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest whole number.

The typing speed is calculated by dividing the length of the generated text by the elapsed time and multiplying the result by 60 to convert
from seconds to minutes. This value is also rounded to the nearest whole number.

Finally, the function prints out the user's input, the elapsed time, the typing accuracy, and the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
