***Introduction to APIs***

There are many Python Libraries to use API's, i'm working on requests library, this library can get and send the data from any websites.
```requests.get(url_string)``` helps us to get data from any url(website), it has keyword arguments.


```params``` keyword used to take a dictionary of parameters and values to customize API requests.


```headers``` keyword used to take a dictionary and provide user authentication to API.

```result``` is a response object, containing data and metadata.

```response.json()``` will return just the JASON data.
