***Introduction to APIs***

There are many Python Libraries to use API's, i'm working on requests library, this library can get and send the data from any websites.
JSON API lets you integrate any external tool. To do this, we need to exchange data between our application and server. To use the web service we need to send requests to web service endpoint URL and receive responses from it.


```requests.get(url_string)``` helps us to get data from any url(website), it has keyword arguments.


```params``` keyword used to take a dictionary of parameters and values to customize API requests.


```headers``` keyword used to take a dictionary and provide user authentication to API.

```result``` is a response object, containing data and metadata.

```response.json()``` will return just the JASON data.

```response.json()```  returns the dictionary 

```read.json()``` only reads  strings  but not dictionaries

***Yelp Using APIs***
All of Yelp API endpoints start with ```https://api.yelp.com/v3``` , followed by the search type path, and finally the parameters.
We can make requests APIs using yelp.

  Yelp provides APIs that allow developers to access and use their data and services in their own applications. 
  The Yelp API provides access to information about businesses, user reviews, photos, and other content from Yelp's database. Developers can use this information to create new apps, tools, and services that leverage Yelp's data.

To use Yelp's API, developers need to first create a Yelp account and obtain an API key.
The API key is used to authenticate requests to the Yelp API and to track usage. Yelp provides documentation and code samples to help developers get started with the API.

Some common use cases for Yelp's API include:

Integrating Yelp data into a business directory or review site.
Creating location-based search tools that leverage Yelp's data.
Building custom mobile apps that use Yelp's data to provide recommendations and reviews.
Analyzing user sentiment and trends across different business categories.
It's important to note that Yelp's API has specific usage limits and guidelines, and developers need to adhere to these guidelines to avoid being blocked from accessing the API.
