***Importing Data From Excel Files***

In the last blog i have mentioned how to read csv files(aka flatflies) and how to handle the missing data using pandas library. 
Likewise, in this blog i would like to explain how the spreadsheets(aka excel sheets) are read and how to handle them using pandas.
As we know that excel file data, are in which contain tabular format having rows and columns and having formulas.

**Loading Excelsheet using pandas**

same as csv file excel sheets can aslo be loaded with function in pandas

We can also use skiprows to specifty rows to skip and usecols to choose column name, positional number or letter("A:F")
