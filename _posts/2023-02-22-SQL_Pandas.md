challenges that i faced,
Finding reliable sources, Now-a-days we can find a lot of information in online, it is difficult to choose which website is reliable or not, 
and there will be a lot of information avaliable that i got difficulties where to start and what is the most important topic to learn and not.
Some technologies can be quite complex, and it can be challenging to understand the concepts
without knowledge or experience. It is important to look for websites that explain concepts in a clear and provide examples and practical applications.
There are many websites that offer free resources for learning new technologies, but sometimes the quality of
these resources may not be as good as those that are paid. It is important to evaluate the quality of the resources and decide whether it 
is worth investing in paid resources.



***Refining imports with SQL queries***
We can combine SQL queries with pandas using alchemy engine using databases.

  ***Introduction to JSON***
  JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
  
  We can read JSON files by using path or url in pandas.
  JSON data is not in tabular form and it can be parse the web data and can be readable. In JSON the data is organized into collection of objects, object refers to the python dictionaries; these are the collection of attribute - value pairs.
  
  JSON can be read by the pandas using ```read_json()``` attribute, pandas takes string path to ```JSON_``` or ```_JSON``` data as a string.
  
  **Data Orientation**
  As we know that JSON data, is not in tabular form, pandas defaultly guesses how to arrage this data in tabular format and also pandas can handle the common orientation automatically.
  
 We can split the data in json file by using ```orient``` argument with different column names, index, and values.

  ***Introduction to APIs***
  
  
  Application Programming Interface defines how to communicate with other programs, we can collect the data using API without the information of the databases.
  We can use different libraries to use APIs which are avaliable in pandas.
  These libraries are used to get data and send data from websites.
